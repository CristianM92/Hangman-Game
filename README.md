# Hangman-Game for two players. One of the players thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters .
The word to be guessed is represented by a string of lines, each line representing a letter of the word. If the guessing player suggests a letter that is in the word, the other player fills in all the positions where it appears. If the letter is not in the word, the other player draws an item from the "hangman" diagram.
The game ends when:
  * The guessing player completes the whole word, or guesses it correctly.
  * The other player completes the chart.
